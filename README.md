 # The House Recommendation System 
is a tool built in ReactJS that allows you to specify the size of the grid by inputting the number of rows and columns you desire. It then generates the grid to assist you in selecting the most suitable house based on the services available in the area.

The system employs an algorithm that takes into account the location of the house and the number of services available in the area to provide you with the best recommendation. These services includes Restaurant, Gym and hospitals. The more services available in the vicinity of the house, the more favorable the recommendation.
